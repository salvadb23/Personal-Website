        <p>
          I am a native of Savannah, Georgia who has migrated 2,754 miles to San
          Francisco to follow my dreams to become a Software Engineer. I have
          the desire to not only consume content on the web but produce it as
          well. I realized my aspiration after researching the makeup of the
          internet. I decided that I would learn how I can contribute to this
          wonderful world. After I acquire the skills needed to call myself a
          Developer, I plan to create tools for change. Whether that's helping
          world leaders manage their data or assisting a local middle school
          with an application to help their students navigate this ever-changing
          world, I'm on the job.
